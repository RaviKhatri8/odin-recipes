        <img src="../images/naan.jpeg">
        <p>This homemade naan recipe makes soft, chewy naan with a buttery taste. It is</p>
        <p>the best I have tasted outside of an Indian restaurant. Simply delicious eaten</p>
        <p>warm brushed with melted butter or served with your favorite curry.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li><p>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off</p> 
                <p>small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14.</p> 
                <p>Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to</p>
                <p>rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
            <li><p>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of</p>
                <p>dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly</p>
                <p>browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook</p>
                <p>until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook</p>
                <p>the remaining naan.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
